description: How to use 8StarLabs UI components in your application.
---

Once an 8StarLabs UI component is installed, you can import it and use it in your application like any other React component. The components are added as part of your codebase (not hidden in a library), so you can edit the components to suit your specific needs.

## Example

After installing 8StarLabs UI components, you can use them in your application like any other React component. For example:

```tsx {1,6} showLineNumbers title="app/page.tsx"
import { StatusIndicator } from "@/components/ui/status-indicator";

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <div className="flex items-center justify-center p-8">
      <StatusIndicator />
    </div>
  );
}
```
